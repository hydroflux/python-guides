# The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories,
# optionally isolated from system site directories. Each virtual environment has it's own Python binary,
# and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories

# Step 1
# Create a virtual environment by executing the command "venv", along with the path to the directory you're
# working in:
# python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment




# Add information about freezing your virtual environment in order to 
# pass the requirements to GitHub
