# What Is A Virtual Environment

The venv module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual environments” with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. Each virtual environment has it's own Python binary, and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories

# 2. Make Sure the "Venv" Package is Installed

# 3. Determine the Location of Your Target Directory

# 4. Create Your Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment by executing the command "venv", along with the path to the directory you're working in:

python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

# 100. Freezing Your Virtual Environment

Add information about freezing your virtual environment in order to 
pass the requirements to GitHub
